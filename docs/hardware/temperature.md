# Temperature sensor

The Maximum continuous current of the Dagor Controller depends on the quality of heat-sinking and cooling. A small heat-sink or a cooling fan can have great impacts on the maximum continuous current the board can handle. The on-board temperature sensor is a great way to assure the user stays within the safe range of operating temperature. The temperature sensor is found near the MOSFETs to obtain a more accurate measurement of the temperature of the controller's power stage. To learn more about this sensor please refer to the [STLM20W87F datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/1810010411_STMicroelectronics-STLM20W87F_C129796.pdf).
