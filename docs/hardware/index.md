# Hardware

This section is dedicated to the people that want to learn about the electronics behind the Dagor Controller and dig deeper into its functionality and limits. There are four main elements that are necessary for its proper operation: microcontroller (logic stage), power stage, voltage converter and temperature sensor.

| Note: The project is currently on the Alpha stage and the design is subject to change in the future. |
