# Microcontroller

The Dagor board uses a 240 MHz, 32 bit, dual-core ESP32 microcontroller for it's logic stage. To learn more about the ESP32, different applications and different modules visit [Espressif's page](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview).

The ESP32 has wireless capabilities, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but most importantly ESP-NOW. ESP-NOW is a communication protocol by Espressif that enables multiple devices to talk wirelessly to each other via short packet transmission.

Due to popular demand of the alpha testers the **Dagor Controller** Alpha 2.4 will come with the ESP32-WROOM-32U. This makes the board have a smaller footprint and has a u.fl connector to attach an external antenna.
