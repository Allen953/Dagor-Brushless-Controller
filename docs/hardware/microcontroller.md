# Microcontroller

1.1 The microcontroller
The Dagor board uses a 240 MHz, 32 bit, dual-core ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 has wireless capabilities, such as WIFI and Bluetooth, but most importantly ESP-NOW. ESP-NOW is a communication protocol by Espressif that enables multiple devices to talk wirelessly to each other via short packet transmission. See section 2.2 to see how to setup your Arduino IDE to be able to flash the ESP32. Due to popular demand of the alpha testers the Dagor Controller Alpha 2.4 will come with the ESP32-WROOM-32U. This makes the board have a smaller footprint and has a u.fl connector to attach an external antenna.
