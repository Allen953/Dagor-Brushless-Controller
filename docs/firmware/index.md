# Firmware

The [firmware](https://github.com/byDagor/Dagor-Brushless-Controller/tree/master/Firmware) was developed in the Arduino development environment as part of the SimpleFOCproject; this code is merely a starting point as itâ€™s encouraged to modify it to fit specific projects. The [firmware](https://github.com/byDagor/Dagor-Brushless-Controller/tree/master/Firmware) has a particular folder name that describes which board revision it belongs to and which version of firmware it is. The name will look something like this:

>**a_DAXXXFXXX**

For example, **a_DA024F010** means firmware version 1.0 for Dagor Controller Alpha 2.4.

[It](https://github.com/byDagor/Dagor-Brushless-Controller/tree/master/Firmware) is separated into 6 tabs (a - f), make sure all .ino files are stored in the folder named the same as the tab *a*.
